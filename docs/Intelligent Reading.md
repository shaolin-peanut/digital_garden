## About
- Intelligent Reading, taken from ***How to Read a Book - Mortimer Adler***, is raising the art of reading above the elementary level, which is just understanding words and sentences, to superior levels, which are inspectional reading, analytical reading and syntopical reading, that allow one to get more comprehension out of a text.
- 3 types of reading, 3 types of notes
	- Inspectional Reading produces structural notes mainly, Analytical Reading leads to conceptual notes, and Syntopical Reading leads to *dialectical* notes (notes about the shape of the discussion several authors engage in)
## How to
- The 4 questions at the core of Active Reading, that you will attempt to answer using the methods outlined below
	1. What is the book about as a whole? (theme and structure)
	2. What is being said in detail, and how? (ideas, assertions and arguments that constitute the author's message)
	3. Is the book true, in whole or in part? (make up your own mind)
	4. What of it? (what is the significance of its message to you, how does it impact your worldview, how does it interact with other things you know, what is implied/suggested that requires further investigation?)
- ### Inspectional Reading
	- > It should never take more than an active uninterrupted hour on it.
	- > The purpose of inspectional reading is to *inspect* the book in order to determine what it says, how it's structured, and to determine whether it deserves further reading.
	- #### Systematic Skimming
		1. Identify the aim/scope of the book, as well as the angle taken by the author, by reading the **title page, preface and the publisher's blurb**
		2. Study the **table of contents** to get an idea of the big ideas of the book and the skeleton of the content (map of the book)
		3. Scan the index to see either influences or terms that are frequently recurring throughout. Optionally, look up some passages involving the *recurring words*, they may touch on the "crux" of the book/unique angle of the author
			1. > By this point, you can determine whether the book is worth reading or not. You may discard it forever, or go further.
		4. Identify **chapters** that seem to have *pivotal arguments*, read the prefacing/ending summaries if they exist, of the first and last paragraphs
		5. Thumb through the book, **read a paragraph here and there** and try to follow the pulsebeat of matter, the line of thought beneath the mountain of words
		6. Read the **conclusion/epilogue** if there is, or whatever chapter/section that seems to conclude/summarize the whole book.
	- #### Superficial Reading
		- Read the book entirely, move fast over the things you don't understand, enjoy the things that you do understand. The goal here is to get the big picture of the book
- ### Analytical Reading
	- [ ] Do Inspectional Reading on a 100 books (easy if you follow the 1hr max rule), before going into this
- ### Syntopical Reading (for much later)
