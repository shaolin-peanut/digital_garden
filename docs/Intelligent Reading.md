### About
- Intelligent Reading, taken from ***How to Read a Book - Mortimer Adler***, is raising the art of reading above the elementary level, which is just understanding words and sentences, to superior levels, which are inspectional reading, analytical reading and syntopical reading, that allow one to get more comprehension out of a text.
### How to
- ### Inspectional Reading
	- >[!NOTE]
	  > -  It should never take more than an active uninterrupted hour on it.
	  >   - The purpose of inspectional reading is to *inspect* the book in order to determine what it says, how it's structured, and to determine whether it deserves further reading.
	- #### Systematic Skimming
		1. Identify the aim/scope of the book, as well as the angle taken by the author, by reading the **title page, preface and the publisher's blurb**
		2. Study the **table of contents** to get an idea of the big ideas of the book and the skeleton of the content (map of the book)
		3. Scan the index to see either influences or terms that are frequently recurring throughout. Optionally, look up some passages involving the *recurring words*, they may touch on the "crux" of the book/unique angle of the author
			1. > [!NOTE]
			   By this point, you can determine whether the book is worth reading or not. You may discard it forever, or go further.

		5. Identify **chapters** that seem to have *pivotal arguments*, read the prefacing/ending summaries if they exist, of the first and last paragraphs
		6. Thumb through the book, **read a paragraph here and there** and try to follow the pulsebeat of matter, the line of thought beneath the mountain of words
		7. Read the **conclusion/epilogue** if there is, or whatever chapter/section that seems to conclude/summarize the whole book.
	- #### Superficial Reading
		- [ ] Articulate it well, it's important despite the name
- ### Analytical Reading
	- [ ] Do Inspectional Reading on a 100 books (easy if you follow the 1hr max rule), before going into this
- ### Syntopical Reading (for much later)
